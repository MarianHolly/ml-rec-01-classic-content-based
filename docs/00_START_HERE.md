### 📊 Project Summary

**What You'll Build**: 
A content-based movie recommendation system that suggests 10 similar movies based on genres and user-generated tags.

**Technologies**: 
Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter

**Dataset**: 
MovieLens 25M (62,000 movies with genres and tags)

**Time Commitment**: 
20-30 hours over 2-3 weeks (10 hours/week)

**Key Algorithms**:
- TF-IDF vectorization for text features
- Cosine similarity for finding similar movies
- Precision@K for evaluation

**Expected Outcome**: 
A professional Jupyter notebook with precision@10 ≥ 0.7, complete with visualizations, evaluation, and documentation ready for your portfolio.

### 🎯 Success Checklist

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- [ ] Load and explore datasets with pandas
- [ ] Perform feature engineering on text data
- [ ] Implement TF-IDF vectorization
- [ ] Calculate similarity between items
- [ ] Build a recommendation function
- [ ] Evaluate recommendation quality
- [ ] Create professional visualizations
- [ ] Document your work thoroughly
- [ ] Explain how content-based filtering works

### 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Follow the phases in order** - each builds on the previous
2. **Don't skip checkpoints** - they catch issues early
3. **Print intermediate results** - verify each step works
4. **Document as you go** - don't leave it for the end
5. **Commit to Git regularly** - after each phase or major milestone
6. **Ask questions** - if stuck, review the relevant document section
7. **Take breaks** - 10 hours/week is sustainable, don't burn out
8. **Celebrate milestones** - acknowledge progress after each phase

---

### 📖 Learning Path

**New to pandas?** 
Focus extra time on Phases 2-4. The documents include explanations of key pandas operations. Print examples and experiment in separate cells.

**New to machine learning?**
Don't worry! The technical specification explains concepts from first principles. Focus on understanding *why* we use each technique, not just *how*.

**New to Jupyter notebooks?**
The code structure document provides a complete template. Follow it exactly for your first project.

### 🔄 After Completing Project 1

Once you finish, you'll be ready for:
- **Project 2**: Enhanced Content-Based Recommender (multiple similarity metrics, diversity optimization)
- **Project 3**: Niche Genre Specialist (Film Noir recommender with domain-specific features)
- **FastAPI Integration**: Turn your notebook into a web API

Each project builds on the previous one, gradually increasing complexity.

### 📞 Need Help?

If you get stuck:
1. **Check the checklist** - did you complete all tasks in the current phase?
2. **Review the technical spec** - does the algorithm make sense?
3. **Inspect your data** - print DataFrames and intermediate results
4. **Simplify** - get something basic working first, then improve
5. **Take a break** - fresh eyes often spot the issue
